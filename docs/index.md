# TypedMemory

**Contract-driven memory for AI agents.**

*Typed schemas. Explicit conflict policies. Structured provenance. Typed event timeline.*

TypedMemory is the layer between data and reasoning where every change is governed by an explicit contract — not learned, not implicit. Every memory has a declared type validated against a profile, a conflict policy that fires deterministically on slot collision, a structured source with dedup identity, and an entry in a first-class event timeline. Memories update on conflict, decay over time, and summarize non-destructively — all under rules you wrote, not rules the system inferred.

                              (contradictions, drift, goals,
                               non-destructive summarization)
```

**Zero runtime dependencies.** Stdlib only — LLM clients, YAML profile loading, and richer embedders are optional extras.

## Why this exists

Most "AI memory" libraries are wrappers around a vector database. That works for "remember what the user said," but it falls apart the moment you want an agent to:

- track **who said what, in which document, at which span**
- handle **the same fact from three sources** without storing it three times
- recognize that **a new decision supersedes the old one** without losing the audit trail
- **summarize stale events** without throwing away the originals
- **isolate** legal memory from medical memory on the same machine
- **flag contradictions** instead of silently overwriting them

TypedMemory treats these as first-class concepts.
