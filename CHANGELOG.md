# Changelog

All notable changes to TypedMemory.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Temporal validity: `Memory.valid_from` / `Memory.valid_to`.** `timestamp` is now unambiguously *observation time*; the new half-open window `[valid_from, valid_to)` says when the *content holds*. Both default to `None` (= unspecified, persisted as such); `Memory.effective_from` is the operational fallback (`valid_from or timestamp`) and `Memory.is_valid_at(t)` tests the window. `valid_from` may be later than `timestamp` (a declared future state). An empty or inverted window raises `ValueError` at construction.
- `typedmem.retrieval.filter_valid()` and a `include_expired` flag on `resolve_temporal()`.
- SQLite stores automatically migrate existing databases to add the two nullable columns; JSONL/in-memory records without them load as `None`.
- Server `MemoryIn`/`MemoryOut`, CLI `add --valid-from/--valid-to`, and the TypeScript client types carry the new fields.

### Changed
- `resolve_temporal()` now keeps only memories valid at `as_of` (default: **now**) — expired *and* future-valid memories are excluded — and does so **before** `latest_per_slot`, so a future `valid_from` cannot shadow the current state. `latest_per_slot` orders by `effective_from` and accepts `as_of`.
- `RetrievalFilters.as_of` matches against the validity window (`is_valid_at`) instead of `timestamp <= as_of`.
- `PolicyEngine.resolve()` judges "older incoming" under `REPLACE` by `effective_from` rather than `timestamp`: a freshly observed memory describing an *earlier* state no longer overwrites the current one.
- `REPLACE` carries the incoming memory's `valid_from`/`valid_to` onto the record, as it already did for `timestamp`.
- Confidence decay is unchanged and still anchored on `timestamp`.

### Fixed
- **`Source.authority` now actually participates in conflict resolution.** The CLI (`--authority`, "weight in conflict resolution") and the `source.py` docstring have promised this since v0.4a, but `PolicyEngine.resolve()` only ever consulted timestamp and confidence. Under `REPLACE`, an incoming memory whose strongest source has *lower* authority than the existing memory's strongest source is now downgraded to `IGNORE` — a newer, more confident model inference (`authority=0.3`) can no longer overwrite an older explicit user statement (`authority=1.0`). Equal or higher authority falls through to the unchanged timestamp/confidence rules. Memories with no `sources` make no authority claim and are resolved exactly as before. Other policies (`SUPERSEDE`, `KEEP_BOTH`, `FLAG`, `REINFORCE`) are untouched; the existing authority weighting in the `REINFORCE` confidence blend is unchanged.
- New helper `typedmem.policy.memory_authority(m)` — the max authority across a memory's sources, or `None`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-18

**Governed State Transitions.** TypedMem v0.8 introduces the first complete kernel for deterministic, policy-governed memory evolution (RFC-0001).

### Added
- `Transition`, an inert description of a proposed state change
- `TransitionEngine`, the single mutation path for store operations and evolvers
- optimistic concurrency through persisted memory versions and `expected_version`
- pluggable `IdentityStrategy`, `ConfidenceStrategy`, and `LifecycleStrategy`
- lifecycle validation for status transitions (`LifecycleError` on an illegal move)
- `store.is_active()` backed by lifecycle policy
- transition events that record the resulting memory version in `payload["version"]`

### Changed
- store add, update, delete, and conflict handling now route through the kernel
- `GoalResolver`, `PreferenceDriftDetector`, and `SummaryEvolver` now submit explicit transitions instead of writing directly
- confidence reinforcement and decay now route through `ConfidenceStrategy`
- SQLite stores automatically migrate existing databases to add `Memory.version`
- legacy JSONL and in-memory records load with `version=1`

### Concurrency semantics
New memories begin at version `1`. Each successful mutation of an existing memory increments its version exactly once. Rejected, ignored, or stale transitions do not modify state.

A transition may supply `expected_version`. If the stored version differs, TypedMem raises `ConcurrencyError` instead of silently overwriting a newer state.

### Compatibility
The existing public store APIs remain supported. Existing persisted memories are migrated automatically and default to version `1`.

Custom SQLite identity strategies currently use a scan-based lookup path. The default slot identity strategy continues to use the existing index.

### Internal architecture
`TransitionEngine` is now the sole mutator of persisted memories. Internal `_put` and `_delete` methods are reserved for engine use, and a systemic test guards against mutation bypasses.

### Kernel API
Public and importable from `typedmem`: `Transition`, `TransitionEngine`, `TransitionResult`, `ConcurrencyError`, `LifecycleError`, `IdentityStrategy`, `SlotIdentityStrategy`, `ConfidenceStrategy`, `PolicyConfidenceStrategy`, `LifecycleStrategy`, `DefaultLifecycleStrategy`. The kernel API is public but **provisional until v1.0**.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-05-26

**Hotfix: `typedmem-client` now dual-package (ESM + CJS).** v0.7.3 published as ESM-only, which broke every CJS consumer using `require('typedmem-client')` with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. This release ships both formats.

### Fixed
- **`typedmem-client@0.7.4`** now exports both ESM (`./dist/index.js`) and CJS (`./dist/index.cjs`) from a single source. `require('typedmem-client')` and `import "typedmem-client"` both work on Node 18+. Existing v0.7.3 ESM-only callers continue to work unchanged.
- **Build switched to [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)** — handles the import-extension rewriting that plain `tsc` gets wrong when targeting both formats from the same `.ts` sources. Adds `tsup` as a devDependency; runtime dependencies remain zero.
- **`package.json` exports map** declares both entry points: `{ "import": "./dist/index.js", "require": "./dist/index.cjs" }`, plus `.d.ts` and `.d.cts` for TypeScript consumers on either side.

### Notes
- **Python package (`typedmem` on PyPI) is unchanged.** Version bumped to 0.7.4 only to keep the typedmem-server / typedmem-client version pairs in lockstep. No Python API or behavior change from 0.7.3.
- **Docker image (`ghcr.io/canis-minor/typedmem:0.7.4`) is unchanged behavior**; rebuild only because the tag triggered it.

### Friction-log entry that produced this fix
First non-trivial consumer (ai-life-tracker's CJS Node backend) hit `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` on first `require('typedmem-client')`. The library should have been dual-package from v0.7.0; the test suite caught nothing because the tests themselves are ESM. Adding a CJS smoke test to CI is worth a follow-up.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-25

CI/release pipeline catches up to the v0.7.0 surface; `typedmem-client` ships to npm. No Python API changes.

### Added
- **`typedmem-client@0.7.3` published to npm** — first publish of the TypeScript client. Install with `npm install typedmem-client`. Gated on the `PUBLISH_NPM` repo variable + `NPM_TOKEN` secret (set both before tagging).

### Changed
- **CI** now installs `pip install -e ".[test,server]"` so `tests/test_server.py` actually runs (previously skipped via `pytest.importorskip("fastapi")` because `[server]` wasn't installed).
- **CI** adds a new `ts-client` job that type-checks (`tsc --noEmit`), runs vitest, and builds the TypeScript client on Node 18 and Node 20.
- **`release.yml`** adds two publish jobs on `v*.*.*` tag push:
  - **GHCR Docker image** — multi-arch (amd64 + arm64), pushed to `ghcr.io/${owner}/typedmem:{version,latest}`. Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no extra secrets needed.
  - **npm publish for `typedmem-client`** — gated on `vars.PUBLISH_NPM == 'true'`. Syncs `package.json` version to the git tag before publishing.
- **`.dockerignore`** added — drops `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `clients/`, `tests/`, `examples/`, `docs/`, `*.db`, and Python build artifacts so the GHCR image stays small.

### Why this patch
v0.7.0 and v0.7.1 shipped without these CI/release files; server tests were silently skipped in CI, no Docker image was published on tag, and the TypeScript client was unreachable for non-Python consumers. This release lands the pipeline that v0.7.0 always assumed and opens the npm distribution channel.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-18

**TypedMemory becomes usable from any language.** v0.7 adds an HTTP server that exposes the existing Python surface over REST, plus a first-class TypeScript client. The Python library is unchanged — every Python API works exactly as before. The new server is an optional extra; default install stays zero-dependency.

### Added — HTTP server (`pip install 'typedmem[server]'`)

- **`typedmem serve`** — CLI command that runs the FastAPI server. Flags: `--store`, `--port`, `--host`, `--api-token`, `--identity-audience` (Google ID-token auth), `--cors-origin`, `--instance-name`, `--dim`, `--log-level`. Reads `TYPEDMEM_API_TOKEN` and `PORT` env vars.
- **REST API under `/v1/`** — every existing Python method has a matching endpoint:
  - `POST /v1/memories` · `GET/DELETE /v1/memories/:id` · `GET /v1/memories` (list with filters)
  - `POST /v1/recall` — server-side hashing-embedder semantic match
  - `GET /v1/memories/:id/history` · `GET /v1/timeline` · `GET /v1/changed-since` — v0.6 event log over HTTP
  - `POST /v1/reflect` · `GET /v1/contradictions` — evolver pipeline
  - `GET /v1/workspaces` · `GET /v1/version` · `GET /healthz`
- **Three auth modes**: bearer token (`--api-token`), Google ID token (`--identity-audience`, for Cloud Run service-to-service IAM), or none (local dev only). Both can be enabled simultaneously — production + local dev side by side. Constant-time token comparison; `google-auth` is lazily imported via the `[gcp]` extra.
- **`create_app(store, embedder, config)` factory** — library-shaped if you want to mount the FastAPI app inside a larger ASGI server.
- **Structured error responses**: `ValueError` → 400 (or 422 for profile rejection), `KeyError` → 404. Body shape: `{error, code, details}`. Clients can branch on `code` without string-parsing.
- **CORS** — opt-in via `--cors-origin` (default off; the server is typically backend-to-backend).
- **`tests/test_server.py`** — 19 endpoint tests via FastAPI `TestClient`. Skipped if the `[server]` extra isn't installed.

### Added — TypeScript client (`clients/typescript/`)

- **`typedmem-client` npm package** — zero runtime deps, native `fetch`, Node 18+ and modern browsers. Mirrors the Python surface: `add`, `get`, `delete`, `list`, `recall`, `history`, `timeline`, `changedSince`, `reflect`, `contradictions`, `workspaces`, `version`, `healthz`.
- **Typed errors** — `NotFoundError`, `UnauthenticatedError`, `ProfileValidationError`, generic `TypedMemoryError`. Subclass on `code`, not on string match.
- **Default workspace per client** — `new TypedMemoryClient({ url, apiToken, workspace })`; every method optionally takes `workspace` to override. Recommended pattern: one workspace per end-user.
- **19 vitest tests** covering request construction, auth header, query-string encoding, error translation.

### Added — Deploy

- **Dockerfile** — `python:3.12-slim`, non-root user, installs `'typedmem[gcp]'`, default entrypoint `typedmem serve --store /data/agent.db`. Multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) image pushed to `ghcr.io/canis-minor/typedmem:{tag,latest}` on every `v*.*.*` tag.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — three publish jobs: PyPI (existing), GHCR Docker image (new), npm publish for the TS client (new, opt-in via `vars.PUBLISH_NPM == 'true'`).
- **`docs/server.md`** — full deploy guide: local, Cloud Run + GCS FUSE mount, Docker, systemd. Includes a Cloud Run service-to-service IAM walkthrough for ai-life-tracker-style integrations.
- **`[gcp]` pyproject extra** — pulls in `google-auth` on top of `[server]`. The documented Cloud Run default.

### Changed

- **`[test]` extra adds `httpx`** so server tests can construct a `TestClient`.
- **CI** runs the test suite with `[test,server]` installed and includes a `ts-client` job that type-checks + tests the TypeScript package on Node 18 and 20.
- **README** gets a "Run as a service" section linking to `docs/server.md`.

### Not in 0.7.0 (deferred to 0.7.x or later)

- Streaming change feeds (Server-Sent Events / WebSocket on `changed-since`)
- Per-user or per-workspace API tokens (currently one global token)
- Sentence-transformer embedder (hashing embedder only)
- Postgres backend for horizontal scale beyond `--max-instances 1`
- gRPC, replication, web UI

### Compatibility

- **Wire format is versioned via the URL prefix.** v0.7 speaks `/v1/`. Future breaking changes get a new prefix; existing clients keep working.
- **TypeScript client major version tracks the server's wire-format version.** `typedmem-client@0.7` talks to `typedmem-server` v0.7.x.
- Python library API is **backwards-compatible with v0.6.2**.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-18

The v0.6 event log gets a CLI surface, and the CLI stops lying about who wrote what.

### Added
- **`typedmem timeline`** — filter the event log by `--subject` / `--type` / `--source` / `--all-workspaces`. AND-combined; omit a filter to match anything. `--json` for piping.
- **`typedmem changed-since <spec>`** — canonical change feed since a point in time. Accepts ISO 8601 (`2026-05-17T12:00:00`) or a relative spec (`5m`, `2h`, `1d`, `1w`, `30s`). Same `--json` flag.
- **`typedmem history --json`** — emit raw `MemoryEvent` dicts for scripting.

### Changed
- **`typedmem add` and `typedmem delete` now tag events as `source="user"`** (with `source_name="cli:add"` / `"cli:delete"`). Previously every CLI write looked indistinguishable from a programmatic `store.add()` — `source="store"`. Now `timeline --source user` shows exactly what a human did through the CLI.
- **`typedmem history` output** gains a source column: `[user/cli:add]`, `[evolver/preference_drift_detector]`, etc. The pre-v0.6.2 format had only `[evolver_name]` which silently labeled `store`-emitted lifecycle events as `[store]`.

### Notes
- No Python API changes from 0.6.1; this release is CLI surface only.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **`examples/belief_refinement_demo.py`** — the canonical v0.6 use case in 60 lines. Simulates four conversations refining the agent's model of a user's testing preferences and walks through `store.history()`, `store.changed_since()`, and the backwards-compatible `store.evolution_history()`. Belief *refinement* over time, not contrived flip-flop reversals.

### Notes
- No API or behavior changes from 0.6.0; this is a docs-and-demo patch.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-17

**Typed memory timeline.** Agents remember not only what they know, but how their beliefs changed over time. The pre-v0.6 `metadata["evolution_history"]` audit list is promoted into a first-class, indexed event log — every `add` / `update` / `delete` emits a typed `MemoryEvent`, not just contested writes. The event stream is the canonical memory change feed.

### Added
- **`MemoryEvent` dataclass** (`typedmem.events`) — typed, round-trippable, with fields `memory_id`, `workspace`, `type`, `subject`, `action`, `source`, `source_name`, `reason`, `input_ids`, `output_ids`, `payload`, `timestamp`, `id`.
- **`EventSource` literal type** — `"store" | "evolver" | "agent" | "user" | "system"`:
  - `store` — automatic lifecycle from `MemoryStore.add/update/delete`
  - `evolver` — `ContradictionSurfacer` / `GoalResolver` / `SummaryEvolver` / `PreferenceDriftDetector`
  - `agent` — caller explicitly tags an agent write (e.g. `AgentMemory.remember`)
  - `user` — caller explicitly tags a human action
  - `system` — migration, import, maintenance (e.g. lazy `evolution_history` migration)
- **Timeline query APIs** on every store:
  - `store.history(memory_id)` — every event for one memory, oldest first; includes the `deleted` event even after the memory row is gone.
  - `store.timeline(subject=..., type=..., workspace=..., source=...)` — filtered event stream.
  - `store.changed_since(timestamp)` — canonical change feed for consumers staying in sync; includes adds, updates, deletes, and evolver-driven transforms.
- **Event-source kwargs on the public API**: `store.add(memory, event_source="agent", event_source_name="agent_loop")` and `store.delete(memory_id, event_source=..., event_source_name=...)`. Defaults are `"store"` / `None`, preserving all v0.5 call sites.
- **`AgentMemory.remember()`** passes `event_source="agent"`, `event_source_name="AgentMemory.remember"`; `AgentMemory.forget()` passes `event_source="agent"`, `event_source_name="AgentMemory.forget"`.
- **SQLite `memory_events` table** with indexes on `memory_id`, `workspace`, `(workspace, type)`, `(workspace, type, subject)`, `timestamp`. Schema upgrades automatically on first open of an existing v0.5 database.
- **JSONLMemoryStore sidecar `.events.jsonl`** file. Memory file `compact()` does NOT compact events — the timeline is the historical record.

### Changed
- **`_record_lifecycle_event`** and **`annotate_history`** now write to the event log instead of `metadata["evolution_history"]`. The 50-entry-per-memory cap is gone.
- **`annotate_history(memory, record)` → `annotate_history(store, memory, record)`** — signature changed; callers in `drift.py`, `goals.py`, `summary.py` updated. External callers using the pre-v0.6 signature will see `TypeError` — update to the new signature.
- **`store.evolution_history(memory_id)`** still returns `list[dict]` in the pre-v0.6 shape, but is now backed by the event log. Entries that lived in `metadata["evolution_history"]` migrate lazily on first access with `source="system"`, `source_name="migrate_evolution_history"`.

### Not in 0.6
- `VersionPolicy` as a separate axis (`HISTORY` / `IMMUTABLE` etc.) — deferred to 0.7. Overlapped with `ConflictPolicy` in confusing ways (`HISTORY` + `REPLACE` is a contradiction; `IMMUTABLE` mostly duplicates `IGNORE`/`FLAG`). Will revisit only if real usage shows per-type timeline behavior needs to differ.
- Sync engine, replication, event replay — `changed_since()` is the quiet side door, but not yet a full mechanism.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-16

Positioning shift: **long-term memory + reflection layer for AI agents.** Same primitives underneath, but now there's a clean four-verb front door for agent frameworks to plug into, and the README leads with what the library *does for an agent* rather than how it's structured underneath.

### Added
- **`AgentMemory` class** — the four-verb contract over the whole pipeline:
  - `remember(text, *, subject=None, source=None)` — extracts + stores; returns the memories added.
  - `recall(query, *, limit=10, types=None, tags=None, since=None)` — semantic + recency + confidence blend, scoped to this agent's workspace.
  - `reflect(*, dry_run=False, include_summary=False)` — runs the evolver pipeline (contradictions / drift / goals / optional LLM summarization) and returns an `AgentMemoryReflection`.
  - `forget(memory_id)` — explicit deletion for privacy / cleanup.
- **`AgentMemoryReflection` dataclass** — aggregated reflection result with a one-line `.summary()` for logging.
- **`typedmem contradictions` CLI verb** — first-class subcommand for the killer feature. Same logic as `evolve --evolver contradictions` but shorter to type and recommend.
- **`examples/agent_loop_demo.py`** — before-vs-after demo: five user utterances, run twice, only the second run can answer "what does the user prefer right now?" or "are they flipping a lot?".
- **README rewrite** — leads with the four-verb agent API; sharpened opening hook ("AI agents start believing their own hallucinations").

### Notes
- `AgentMemory` is purely a wrapper around existing primitives — no new logic, no behavior change. v0.4.x code using `MemoryStore` / `Retriever` / Evolvers directly continues to work unchanged.
- The agent-loop demo intentionally uses only the default `personal` profile and the rule-based extractor; no LLM key required.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-16

Conflict resolutions now leave an audit trail — the same surface Evolvers populate. The "debug hallucinating agents" story is finally backed by data you can actually inspect.

### Added
- `_apply_conflict` writes an `EvolutionRecord`-shaped entry to `metadata["evolution_history"]` for every state change:
  - **SUPERSEDE** — `superseded` on the old memory + `supersedes` on the new
  - **REPLACE** — `replaced` with a snippet of the prior content
  - **REINFORCE** — `reinforced` with the new source ids merged in (only when there are new unique sources)
  - **FLAG** — `flagged` on both memories, cross-referencing
- `typedmem history MEMORY_ID` now returns a meaningful lifecycle for memories that were superseded, replaced, reinforced, or flagged. Previously it returned "(no evolution history)" because only Evolver actions wrote to it.
- README **Use cases** section — debugging hallucinating agents, multi-doc RAG with provenance, long-running personal assistants, design-doc agents, multi-tenant agents.

### Notes
- KEEP_BOTH intentionally writes nothing — it's not a state change worth logging.
- `evolver: "store"` distinguishes conflict-resolution entries from Evolver-produced ones in the same history list.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-16

Quality-of-life patch addressing first-paste UX feedback after the v0.4.0 launch.

### Added
- `RuleBasedExtractor` now recognizes residence and affiliation patterns: `lives in / lives at / based in / works at / works for / studies at / is from / am from`. These land as `fact` memories so casual biographical statements no longer return "no memories extracted".
- Goal patterns now match third-person (`user wants to`, `she plans to`, `he is going to`) in addition to first-person. Previously only `i want to` / `we want to` matched.

### Fixed
- The CLI's `evolve --evolver contradictions` now prints the **contents** of each clustered memory instead of just their UUIDs — readable enough to paste into a README or demo recording.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-15

First public release. The library now extracts, stores, retrieves, and **evolves** structured memory for AI agents — a complete pipeline behind one zero-dependency install.

### v0.4c — Memory Evolution
- New `Evolver` protocol, symmetric to `Extractor` but reading existing memories.
- `EvolutionRecord` / `EvolutionResult` provide a per-action audit trail.
- `ContradictionSurfacer` — pure-read graph walk over `metadata["conflicts_with"]`.
- `PreferenceDriftDetector` — uses `metadata["replace_log"]` (auto-written on every REPLACE) to flag unstable preferences.
- `GoalResolver` — semantic match between active goals and evidence; strict-by-default threshold (0.85); `dry_run` previews; one-level `revert`.
- `SummaryEvolver` — **non-destructive**: clusters stale memories by `(workspace, type, subject)`, asks an LLM for one short summary, creates a new memory linked via `metadata["summarizes"]`. Originals never modified or deleted.
- Every mutating action writes an `EvolutionRecord` into the affected memory's `metadata["evolution_history"]` (capped at 50 entries).
- Store helpers: `MemoryStore.contradictions()`, `drift_flags()`, `evolution_history(id)`.
- CLI: `typedmem evolve --evolver {contradictions,drift,goals} [--apply]`; `typedmem history MEMORY_ID`.

### v0.4b — Domain Profiles
- `TypeSpec` + `DomainProfile` make the type system pluggable.
- Seven built-in profiles: `core`, `personal`, `child_development`, `research_paper`, `engineering_design`, `legal`, `medical_literature`.
- Profiles can opt into shared `core` types (fact/note/goal/task/event) via `include_core_types=True` or `DomainProfile.with_core(...)`.
- `LLMExtractor(profile=...)` validates extracted memories against the profile's declared types and `required_fields`.
- `MemoryStore.for_profile(profile, ...)` enforces strict write-time validation.
- `Memory.type` is now a string; `MemoryType` enum stays importable as a back-compat alias.
- `PolicyEngine` rekeyed to strings; `from_profile()` classmethod.
- Profile loaders: `from_json()` (stdlib), `from_yaml()` (optional `[yaml]` extra).
- CLI: `--profile NAME`, `--profile-file PATH`, `typedmem profiles` subcommand.

### v0.4a — Foundation
- Structured `Source` provenance (`document_id`, `chunk_id`, `span`, `retrieved_at`, `authority`); `Source.key()` for REINFORCE dedup.
- `workspace` namespace on every `Memory`; queries default to `default_workspace`; `MemoryStore.workspaces()`.
- Six-way `ConflictPolicy`: `REPLACE` / `KEEP_BOTH` / `SUPERSEDE` / `REINFORCE` / `FLAG` / `IGNORE`.
- `PolicyEngine.resolve()` returns a `ConflictAction`; weaker incoming downgrades REPLACE to IGNORE.
- `MemoryStore._apply_conflict` dispatches all six policies.
- SQLite migration runner (no JSON1 dependency); legacy `source: str` lifted into structured `sources: list[Source]`.
- CLI: `--workspace`, `workspaces` subcommand, `--document-id` / `--uri` / `--authority` on `add`.

### v0.3 — LLM Extraction Layer
- `LLMClient` protocol; `FakeClient` for offline tests; `OpenAIClient` (extra `[openai]`); `AnthropicClient` (extra `[anthropic]`).
- `LLMExtractor` with `ExtractionResult` debug shape (`raw_response`, `parsed_json`, `validation_errors`, `accepted_memories`).
- Tolerant JSON parsing: strips code fences, recovers arrays from prose-wrapped output.
- Built-in prompt templates: `general`, `child_development`.

### v0.2 — Durable + Searchable Memory
- `JSONLMemoryStore` (append-only with last-write-wins, `compact()`).
- `SQLiteMemoryStore` (indexed, persists embeddings).
- `EmbeddingProvider` protocol; `HashingEmbeddingProvider` default (zero-dep).
- `Retriever.relevant()` blends semantic + recency + decayed confidence.
- CLI: `add`, `search`, `list`, `delete`, `compact`.

### v0.1 — Foundation
- `Memory` dataclass + `MemoryType` enum.
- Five-type `PolicyEngine` with half-life decay.
- `RuleBasedExtractor`.
- `InMemoryStore`.
- Child-development tracking demo.
