"""Minimal typed retrieval pipeline (v0, pre-benchmark).

A modular query → typed-routing → typed-filters → vector-candidates →
temporal-resolution → reranking → top-k pipeline. Each stage is importable and
benchmarkable on its own; ``TypedRetriever`` composes them.

Not the final retrieval architecture — deliberately excludes graph traversal,
multi-hop reasoning, LLM reranking, and learned ranking. The point is a clean
baseline for evaluating whether typed retrieval beats vector-only retrieval.
